The first line:
      FMP,FMA,ZP,ZA

The second line:
     iopde1,iopde2

IF iopde1 is 0 the code uses the 2pF parametrization for the projectile density
IF iopde1 is 1 the code reads an external file for the projectile density. 
The name of this file is projectile.de1 and is composed by the radius, matter 
density and charge density.

IF iopde2 is 0 the code uses the 2pF parametrization for the target density
IF iopde2 is 1 the code reads an external file for the target density. 
The name of this file is target.de2 and is composed by the radius, matter 
density and charge density.



The third line:
     Emin,Emax

Defines the minimum and maximum value of energy. The S-factors are 
calculted in steps of 100 KeV.
